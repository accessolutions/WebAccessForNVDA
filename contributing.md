## Requirements

This is an add-on targeting the NVDA screen reader version 2016.3 or greater. 

The following software is required in order to build this add-on:

- a Python distribution (2.7 or greater 32 bits is recommended).
  Check the [Python website](http://www.python.org) for Windows Installers.
- GNU Gettext tools. You can find windows builds
  [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/downlinks/gettext.php).

Additional requirements (see installation procedure in the next section):
 - SCons - [Website](http://www.scons.org/) - version 3.0.0
 - Markdown-2.0.1 or greater, to convert documentation files to HTML documents.


## Virtual environment

The recommended way to setup a Python build environment is to use `virtualenv`.

It is especially true when using different versions and flavours of the Python
interpreter or working on projects that might have conflicting dependencies. 

In this section, we will assume your Python 2.7 32 bits interpreter is *not*
in the `PATH` environment variable. In later sections, we will assume it
either is or you activated (as we recommend) the dedicated virtual environment.

The following commands use our dev team installation paths, amend according to
your needs.


### Install `virtualenv`
 	
```
D:\dev\Python27-32\Scripts\pip install virtualenv
```


### Create a home folder for your virtual environments

```
md D:\dev\venv
```


### Create a new virtual environment

```
D:\dev\Python27-32\Scripts\virtualenv.exe D:\dev\venv\nvda-addon
```

	
### (Optional) Inject references

We will inject in the new virtual environment references to the targetted
NVDA source code and its Python dependencies.

This step is not strictly necessary, but it eases IDE integration and the
use of code linters / style checkers.

From the root folder you store your projects in:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules "https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda.git"
cd nvda
git checkout --recurse-submodules release-2018.3.2
```

Then, create a `.pth` file in the `site-packages` of your virtual
environment containing the paths - in Windows format - to the cloned
source and dependancies, one line for each.

Example of a typical `nvda.pth` file:

```
D:\dev\src\nvda\source
D:\dev\src\nvda\include\scons\src\engine
D:\dev\src\nvda\include\pyserial
D:\dev\src\nvda\include\comtypes
D:\dev\src\nvda\include\wxPython
D:\dev\src\nvda\miscDeps\python
```

This exhaustive list is obtained from looking at the file
`source/sourceEnv.py` in the NVDA source tree.

Finally, copy the file `scons.py` from the root of this project to the
`Scripts` directory of the virtual environment.
This is just a small convenience script allowing easier invocation of the
SCons found in the cloned NVDA sub-module.


### If using Git Bash, the `activate` script might need to be fixed.

The `VIRTUAL_ENV` variable it defines holds a path in Windows format.

This has no impact if calling Python commands from the same hard disk unit
but would prevent ie. calling a `python.exe` on drive `D:` from your home
folder on drive `C:`.

The script can be patched in-place with the following command:

```
sed -E -i 's/^(VIRTUAL_ENV=)(.+)$/echo \1\\""$(cygpath \2)"\\"/e' /d/dev/venv/nvda-addon/Scripts/activate
```


### Activate the virtual environment.

```
D:\dev\venv\nvda-addon\Script\activate.bat
```

or from Git Bash:

```
. /d/dev/venv/nvda-addon/Scripts/activate
```
	
Note the leading period, meaning the script is sourced, not run.

Your command prompt should now be prefixed with the name of the virtual
environment in parenthesis.

Any subsequent command will be run in the context of this virtual
environment.
The corresponding `python.exe` is now the first in your `PATH` environment
variable, whether another one was already present or not.
Furthermore, packages installed via `pip` will land in this virtual
environment instead of the base Python installation.

You can later run `deactivate` to leave this virtual environment, but let's
first finish to set it up.

### Install the remaining build dependencies:

```
pip install "Markdown>=2.0.1"
```

Optionally, if you did not create a `nvda.pth` file the in virtual environment:

```
pip install "SCons==3.0.0"
```


The new `nvda-addon` virtual environment is now ready to build our addon.

Note that it can also be used by many IDEs, such as PyDev for Eclipse, as
the interpreter for the project. 


## Build

This add-on is based upon the
[addonTemplate](https://bitbucket.org/nvdaaddonteam/addontemplate)
from the NVDA Add-ons Team and, as such, is built using SCons.


Depending on your environment, your SCons command might be either `scons.py`
or `scons.bat`. As a convention, `scons` will be used within this document.


The following commands are to be run from the project root folder. 


### Generate Gettext POT translation file

```
scons pot
```


The resulting `WebAccess.pot` file will be created (or updated) in the project
root folder.


### Build the installation package

```
scons
```


The resulting `WebAccess-<version>.nvda-addon` file will be created (or
updated) in the project root folder.


### Cleaning

In order to ease in place execution during development, the manifest
and documentation files generated by the build process are stored within the
source tree, instead of a separate `build` folder.

To get rid of them:

```
scons -c
```



To also get rid of the generated Gettext POT translation file:

```
scons -c pot
```


## Install

This project follows NVDA standards regarding installation of `.nvda-addon`
files.


However, one might want to use a development version executed directly from
the source tree.

A possible solution is to use file-system junction. Run the following command
from the current user config `addons` directory:

```
mklink /J WebAccess <path to the addon folder in the source tree>
```

Note: Local administrator privileges are required.


In this configuration, run the following command from the same
directory to remove the junction, uninstalling the development version:

```
rd WebAccess
```
